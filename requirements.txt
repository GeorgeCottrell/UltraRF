# UltraRF Python Dependencies
# Core dependencies for the UltraRF protocol implementation

# No external dependencies required for basic simulation
# In a real implementation, you would add:
# - SDR libraries (like GNU Radio bindings)
# - RF hardware interface libraries
# - Signal processing libraries

# For development and testing:
pytest>=7.0.0
mypy>=1.0.0
