2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GeorgeCottrell/UltraRF/ultrarf.git
   cd ultrarf-protocol
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
5. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

#### Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 (enforced by `black` and `flake8`)
- **C++**: Follow Google C++ Style Guide
- **GNU Radio**: Follow GNU Radio coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes

#### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass: `pytest tests/`
- Add integration tests for protocol features
- Test with actual SDR hardware when possible
- Document test results in pull request

#### Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation for any API changes
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Ensure CI/CD checks pass
4. Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
5. Submit PR with clear description of changes
6. Be responsive to code review feedback

### Documentation Contributions

Good documentation is crucial for adoption. You can help by:

- Improving installation guides
- Writing tutorials and how-tos
- Creating diagrams and flowcharts
- Updating API documentation
- Translating documentation
- Fixing typos and clarifying confusing sections

### Hardware Contributions

- Test with different SDR platforms
- Design and test frequency converters
- Optimize antenna configurations
- Document hardware setups that work well
- Share PCB designs for custom hardware

### Testing and QA

- Field test the protocol in real conditions
- Report performance metrics
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Participate in coordinated test events
- Document interference observations

## üìã Development Priorities

Current high-priority areas needing contributions:

1. **LDPC Implementation**: Optimize error correction coding
2. **Channel Bonding**: Implement multi-channel aggregation
3. **Mesh Routing**: Port BATMAN to RF-aware metrics
4. **GNU Radio Blocks**: Create reusable signal processing blocks
5. **FPGA Acceleration**: Implement critical paths in FPGA
6. **Web Dashboard**: Create monitoring/configuration interface

## üîß Technical Guidelines

### Protocol Layers

When working on specific protocol layers:

#### Physical Layer
- Maintain spectral efficiency targets
- Ensure FCC bandwidth compliance
- Document modulation parameters
- Consider hardware limitations

#### MAC Layer
- Minimize overhead and latency
- Implement fair channel access
- Support QoS for emergency traffic
- Handle hidden node problem

#### Network Layer
- Optimize for dynamic RF links
- Implement self-healing capabilities
- Scale to 50+ nodes
- Minimize routing overhead

### Performance Considerations

- Target <10ms latency for time-critical operations
- Minimize CPU usage for embedded deployments
- Use SIMD instructions where available
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks

## üìù Commit Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Follow conventional commits format:
  ```
  type(scope): subject
  
  body
  
  footer
  ```
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep commits focused and atomic
